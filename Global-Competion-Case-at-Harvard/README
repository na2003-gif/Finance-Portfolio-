 Harvard Global Case Competition 2025 — M&A Strategy: Ferrari × Pirelli

Participating as the HUSTlers team from the HUST Business Analysis Club (HBAC), we developed a comprehensive M&A strategy report addressing the competition’s key question:

“Should Ferrari acquire Pirelli?”

After in-depth analysis, our team concluded that while acquiring Pirelli could provide cost and quality advantages, it would also dilute Ferrari’s focus on its core high-performance hybrid and EV segments. Instead, we proposed an alternative acquisition target — Solid Power Inc., a leading developer of solid-state battery technology — to strengthen Ferrari’s EV innovation and electrification strategy.

By applying financial valuation methods and strategic analysis frameworks, we presented a feasible alternative that enables Ferrari to sustain its technological leadership in the luxury sports car industry without the integration risks of acquiring Pirelli.
