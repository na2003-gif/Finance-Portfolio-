Honestly, it was one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had — two months of training at Deloitte meant cake, tea, free parties… and, of course, 8 million in our pocket 
I just had to study over 1,000 pages of international tax (CPA-level), burn the midnight oil, and let them write about us, (https://sem.hust.edu.vn/sinh-vien-truong-kinh-te-dat-giai-runner-up-deloitte-tax-challenge-2025.sem).
Shout-out to my mentor, my big brother, my teammate Dat, who inspired me to dive into this whole finance thing.
Finance, to me, is still a love–hate relationship — and maybe that’s why it’s fun. 

In the national final round, our task was to analyze a cross-border share disposal case between Malaysia and Vietnam.
We advised on income tax and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) implications, computed tax exposure, and assessed compliance procedures and reporting obligations. We also compared the Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT) with the newly introduced CGT regime and discussed recent tax policy measures implemented by the Malaysian government to enhance tax collection.
What we presented in the slides was only a summary of our analysis.
Most of our time, effort, and technical discussion went into explaining the reasoning, exemptions, and compliance strategies directly to the Board of Directors during the oral presentation, rather than the visuals themselves.
